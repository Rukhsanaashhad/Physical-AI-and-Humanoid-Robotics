# Research Plan: Enhance Robotics Book Docs

## Research Areas

### 1. Docusaurus Structure for Large Coursebooks
**Decision**: N/A (Research in Progress)
**Rationale**: N/A
**Alternatives Considered**: N/A
**Task**: Investigate best practices for structuring Docusaurus documentation for a multi-module coursebook, including navigation, versioning, and search optimization.

### 2. SpaceKit Integration with Docusaurus
**Decision**: N/A (Research in Progress)
**Rationale**: N/A
**Alternatives Considered**: N/A
**Task**: Explore methods for seamlessly integrating SpaceKit (for 3D visualizations) into Docusaurus pages. This includes identifying compatible Docusaurus plugins or custom component development.

### 3. ROS 2 Code Example Integration & Interactivity
**Decision**: N/A (Research in Progress)
**Rationale**: N/A
**Alternatives Considered**: N/A
**Task**: Research techniques for embedding ROS 2 code examples in Docusaurus, focusing on syntax highlighting, potential for interactive execution (e.g., in-browser simulations or sandbox environments), and version management for code snippets.

### 4. Interactive Learning Components in Docusaurus
**Decision**: N/A (Research in Progress)
**Rationale**: N/A
**Alternatives Considered**: N/A
**Task**: Identify suitable libraries, frameworks, or custom development approaches for integrating interactive learning components (e.g., quizzes, embedded simulations, interactive diagrams) within a Docusaurus site. Evaluate feasibility and user experience impact.
