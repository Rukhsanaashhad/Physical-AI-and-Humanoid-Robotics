# Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics Documentation

This repository hosts the official documentation for the Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics course, built using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/). This documentation aims to provide a comprehensive and interactive learning experience, integrating 3D visualizations, ROS 2 code examples, and interactive quizzes.

## Quickstart

This guide covers the basic steps to set up, run, and build the documentation locally.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (LTS version)
- npm (Node Package Manager)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd <repository-name>
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

### Local Development

To start the local development server:

```bash
npm start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server. Your site will be available at `http://localhost:3000` (or another port if 3000 is in use).

### Build

To build a static version of the documentation for deployment:

```bash
npm run build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory. These files can then be served using any static hosting service (e.g., GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel).

### Deployment

If you are using GitHub pages for hosting, you can deploy your site using:

```bash
npm run deploy
```

This command is a convenient way to build the website and push to the `gh-pages` branch.

## Contributing

4.  Make your changes, ensuring consistency and accuracy with existing content.
5.  Test your changes locally using `npm start`.
6.  Submit a pull request with a clear description of your changes.

Thank you for helping us enhance the learning experience!
