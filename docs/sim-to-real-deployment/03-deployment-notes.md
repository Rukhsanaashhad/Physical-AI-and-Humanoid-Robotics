# From Simulation to Real-World Deployment

This section explores the critical process of "Sim-to-Real" deployment in robotics, covering strategies, challenges, and best practices for successfully transferring robotic behaviors developed in simulation to physical hardware.

## Key Considerations:

1.  **Reality Gap**: Understanding and bridging the discrepancies between simulation and the real world.
2.  **Sensor Fidelity**: Matching simulated sensor data to real-world sensor characteristics.
3.  **Actuator Dynamics**: Calibrating and controlling real-world actuators to match simulated counterparts.
4.  **Transfer Learning**: Techniques for leveraging simulated training data for real-robot learning.
5.  **Safety and Robustness**: Ensuring safe operation and robustness in unpredictable real-world environments.

## Strategies:
-   Domain Randomization
-   Domain Adaptation
-   System Identification
-   Reinforcement Learning from Simulation (RL-to-Real)
